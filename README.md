## 🏫 Project Affiliation  

This project, **DermalScan: AI Facial Skin Aging Detection**, was developed as part of the  
**Infosys Springboard 6.0 Program** — an initiative to promote hands-on learning in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning.  

Under this program, the project integrates **computer vision** and **machine learning** concepts into a practical healthcare use case.  
It combines **dermatological image analysis** and **facial aging prediction** using advanced AI tools such as:  

- **TensorFlow / Keras (MobileNetV2)** for skin-condition classification  
- **OpenCV DNN** for face and age detection  
- **Streamlit** for deployment and visualization  

This project was mentored and executed under **Infosys Springboard’s AI/ML Learning Path**,  
with the goal of developing an **AI-driven diagnostic and skincare-assistance tool**.

## 🎯 Project Objective  

To identify facial aging indicators — such as **wrinkles, dark spots, puffy eyes, scars**, and **clear skin** — using computer vision and deep learning.  
It uses a combination of **MobileNetV2 (Keras)** for classification and **OpenCV DNN models** for multi-face detection and age estimation.
